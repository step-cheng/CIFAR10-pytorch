# CIFAR10-pytorch
Implementing various machine learning architectures and training on CIFAR10

Made my own machine learning model first to become familiar with the PyTorch framework

Also playing around with transfer learning with VGG, ResNet-18, Resnet-50, MobileNet

Current Accuracies:
My Model: 71.52%
ResNet18: 47.24%
VGG19: 57.9%
ResNet50:
